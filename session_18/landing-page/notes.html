        <li>getElementById()</li>
        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
        <li>getBoundingClientRect()
          <ul>
            <li><i>HINT</i>: <b>getBoundingClientRect().top</b> will get you the top location of a section.
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="build-nav">
      <h3>Build the navigation menu dynamically based on the number of sections</h3>
      <p><i>HINT</i>: Use <em>console.log()</em> to log out values and see what they are, this will help you visualize the data as you are grabbing it and creating it.</p>
      <p><i>HINT</i>: An li by default does not have the finger cursor which people recognize as for clicking.  To change that, in your CSS use `li {cursor:pointer;}` to give li elements the click more noticably.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For each section element on the page you need to create a corresponding li to append to the nav
          <ul>
            <li>Select all sections on the page.</li>
            <li>Loop through them</li>
            <li>The title for the li should be the data-nav value from the section element</li>
            <li>The id of the section is what you will use as the scroll target when clicking the li</li>
            <li>Create and then build the li element, once you have the title set for it and the id attribute set on it, append it to the nav</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="handle-click">
      <h3>When a nav item is clicked, corresponding section should be scrolled into view</h3>
      <p><i>HINT</i>: Again, utilize the <em>console.log()</em> to check you are getting the expected values on click, once that is happening set up moving to the correct section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you are building out the li element, after you append them to the nav add an event listener to listen for a "click" on them</li>
        <li>When clicked you scroll to the matching section.
          <ul>
            <li>This is done via the <i>id</i> value.  The id value on the li tells you which section you need to scroll to (the scrollTarget that is)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="handle-scroll">
      <h3>When the page is scrolled, using the mouse for example, and a section is visible in the viewport</h3>
      <p><i>HINT</i>: Utilize <em>window.scrollYOffset</em> to track where you are positioned in the window when scrolling.  Us that value to check for the boundries of sections to know what section to make "active".</p>
      <ul>
        <li>set an event listener on the window to listen for "scroll".</li>
        <li>When the window's scroll event listener triggers call a method to check where you are on the page and determine what sections boundries you are inside of.
          <ul>
            <li><i>HINT</i>: If you know the top of all the sections then all you need to check is if you are after one sections top but before anothers.
              <ul>
                <li>Ex. If section1's top is at 500px and Section2's top is at 1000px, then when you are scrolling, if you are at 750px you know you are in section 1.
              </ul>
