// RECOMMENDED STEPS
//
// Include the JS file in the HTML
// SET UP THE NAV BAR
// Get a reference to each section on the page
//  * get it's id value
//  * get it's name from the data-nav attribute
// Get a reference to the UL that exists in the HTML
// Create LI elements to add to the nav
//  * the href needs to be the section ID
//  * the name is the name value from the data-nav attribute on the section
//  * add a class to the element
//  * add an event listener to the li
//    * get the id
// Append li elements to the ul
//  * they should have a data-id attrbute that matches the id of the section
//  * their name should be the readable title of the section
// HANDLE SCROLL
// Using the sections variable you created earlier get thier top positions on the page and store the values in an array
// Using the window object track the current scroll position
// On scroll check the current scroll position and get the section it is inside by checking what two points it is between
//
