/**
 * You can add Javascript to an HTML page in two ways:
 *    1. Adding logic directly within the <script> tag
 *
 *        <script>
 *          alert("I am a script");
 *        <script>
 *
 *    2. Using an external ".js" script file using the
 *       "src" attribute in a <script> tag
 *
 *        <script src="./path/to/some-script.js"></script>

/**
 * Statements - set of programming instructions
 *    A block statement is used to group zero or more statements.
 *    The block is delimited by a pair of curly braces {}.
 *
 * Literals - fixed values
 *    100 is a number literal
 *    “John Doe” is a string literal
 *
 * Variables - used to store data values
 *    Keywords: var, let, const
 *    Equal sign is used to assign values to variables, e.g. let x = 6;

/**
 * There are eight different data types in JavaScript. Can you
 * describe them all?
 *
 *    1. Undefined
 *    2. Null
 *    3. Boolean
 *    4. String
 *    5. Number
 *
 * We haven't covered the data types below. Do a quick Google and
 * share what you find.
 *
 *    6. BigInt
 *    7. Object
 *    8. Symbol
